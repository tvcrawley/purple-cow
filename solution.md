# Project Purple Cow

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting up the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode at the default port of 3000.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This port can be reconfigured by changing the PORT line in the `package.json` to the desired number.
> "start": "PORT=3000 react-scripts start",

After updating the port, restart the server and navigate to the appropriate localhost port number in the browser.

## Future Updates
- Add additional styling
    - Incorporate a css framework
- Include a Dockerfile

## Assumptions
- Knowledge of Docker configuration
